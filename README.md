# Advent of Code

## Intro

I will use this repo to improve my skills and learn new/different languages using the challenges that Advent of Code offers.

I don't claim the solutions to be better than those from other participants, the goal here is to learn and come up with the solutions myself.

Lastly, I'll try to keep this up to date and revisit the challenges to update them in parallel with my advancing in different languages.
